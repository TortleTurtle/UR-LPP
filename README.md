# Urban Reef Low Power Payload 
 The Urban Reef Low Power Payload was developed to encode and decode sensor data to a binary array to be sent using LoRaWan technology.
 The decoder was written using plain javascript for The Thing Network. The Decoder was written in C++ and set-up as a 
 Platformio library for easy development and implementation.
